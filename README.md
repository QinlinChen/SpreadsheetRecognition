# SpreadsheetRecognition

SpreadsheetRecognition is a project that aims to recognize the spreadsheet
from a PPT taken by your smart phone or simply from a screenshot
and then split them into cells. 
It is a subproject of [TabularBugDetector](https://github.com/NJUBroccoli/TabularBugDetector),
an Android project that uses camera to take photos, detects PPTs, recognizes spreadsheet 
and finally detects the smells, or say bugs of spreadsheet.

## Notes
* It is a Visual Studio Project. If you don't want to use VS, just puck up `main.cpp`,
`SpreadsheetRecognition.cpp/h` and `Stopwatch.cpp/h` and compile them in your favor.
* I prepared five naive test caes, from `test1.jpg` to `test5.jpg`.

## TODO
* Make it robust and self-adapted to more test cases.
